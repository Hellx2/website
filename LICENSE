        clearly shown at the top of the file.

"Distributor": The creator(s) of any given text under this license,

CONDITIONS:

1. No individual may present any texts under this license as their own,
   and to use any of the texts, they must be included on an as is basis,
   with the following document included:
      
      All given text originating from [distributor] is licensed and may
      be distributed on an AS-IS basis, but ownership cannot be proclaimed

2. If redistributed code under this license fails to work in the redistributor's
   environment, unless by the distributor or tech support, any changes that
   may break the environment cannot be used as a legal reason to file a complaint
   or lawsuit in the case of loss of code.

3. All code under this license must be well enough documented that any user
   that attempts to use it can do so with sufficient knowledge of what it does
   to prevent any unwarranted losses. If code is lost due to insufficiently
   documented deletion protocols, then a lawsuit may be filed towards the
   distributor.

4. If redistributed code is used for any intent that could be considered
   malicious, the original distributor may not be presented as an offendor
   in law unless specifically involved in the redistribution. The same 
   applies to any workers who are uninvolved or had insufficient knowledge
   to realise what it did, although they may still be called upon as witnesses.

5. Any clients using the redistributed code through a company may not be
   considered involved in malicious activity unless they use it for their
   own personal gain or to attack another individual.
